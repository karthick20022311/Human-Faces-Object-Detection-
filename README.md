# 👤 Human Face Detection (Object Detection)

This project is a Streamlit web app that performs real-time face detection using MTCNN and simulates a simple ML model to predict whether an image contains multiple faces. It includes data simulation, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), and predictions—all in a single-page app.
